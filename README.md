# RoboCup-Logistics-League
The RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL) is a league of the annual international robotics competition RoboCup. It focuses on in-factory logistics applications. Following the RoboCup spirit this leagueâ€™s objective is to enable scientific work in order to achieve a flexible solution of material and informational flow within industrial production using coordinated teams of autonomous mobile robots.   The task of the robots is to fetch raw materials from an input storage, transport them in a dynamic sequences between machines, handling production at these machines, and finally deliver them. A team consists of three robots. Each robot builds on the standardized Festo Robotino robot platform which can be extended with sensors and computing devices.
